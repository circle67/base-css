# Base CSS

A simple, opinionated CSS reset + a little more.

What it does:

* Sets `box-sizing` to `border-box` on all elements
* Sets a default font family on the body and sets a font family for monospace elements (customizable!)
* Removes margin and padding on all elements
* Add paragraph spacing on certain typographic elements (`<p>` and headings)
* Moves list numbering/bullets/etc. inside the list (since padding was removed)
* Makes various external resources block elements with a `max-width` of 100%
* More (view the simple [source stylesheet](https://github.com/circle67/base-css/blob/master/src/base.scss) for specifics)
